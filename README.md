# CryptShield X50

**CryptShield X50** is an advanced encryption and decryption algorithm designed to ensure high-level security for digital communications. With a key utilizing over **10⁵⁰ combinations**, this project offers robust protection for sensitive messages by making brute-force attacks computationally infeasible.

## Features
- **High Security**: Leveraging a cryptographic key space of over **10⁵⁰ combinations**.
- **Encryption/Decryption**: Efficient algorithms for encoding and decoding sensitive information.
- **Message Protection**: Ensures confidentiality, protecting data from unauthorized access.
- **Customizable Key Size**: Users can define key sizes based on security needs.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works across different platforms, ensuring seamless integration in any environment.

## How It Works
CryptShield X50 uses a hybrid approach to encryption and decryption, combining symmetric encryption with an extended key length, which is resistant to brute-force attacks. The algorithm generates a secure key from user-defined input, which is then applied to encrypt or decrypt messages.

### Encryption Process:
1. **Input**: User provides the plain text and encryption key.
2. **Algorithm**: The algorithm processes the text using the defined key.
3. **Output**: The encrypted message (ciphertext) is generated.

### Decryption Process:
1. **Input**: User provides the encrypted text and the same key used for encryption.
2. **Algorithm**: The decryption algorithm processes the ciphertext.
3. **Output**: The original plain text is recovered.
